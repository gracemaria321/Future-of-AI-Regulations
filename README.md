Authors: Grace Maria, Jurema Martins, Nitin Sudhakar, Chittranjan Kumar Garg

Artificial Intelligence is reshaping societies, economies, and geopolitics and the legal world is racing to catch up. Every nation has their own perspectives on the use of AI in various sectors and has their own regulations. 
Europe has been positioning itself as a frontrunner by guiding ethical principles and regulations in the world of information technology, robotics and now in AI. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that came into effect in 2018 is an example of a regulation initiative that originated from Europe and extended its scope world-wide giving it a global acceptance.
The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is the European Unionâ€™s landmark legislation designed to regulate AI technologies across member states. It officially came into force on August 1, 2024, and is being phased in over several years. 
The EU AI Act being one of the first AI regulations that came into recognition world-wide, its scope, acceptance, significance, limitations, loopholes and risks vary from region to region, country to country. Hence, the future of this Act can take AI and its applications to new levels and bring more challenges along these possibilities.
